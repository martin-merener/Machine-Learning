Perceptron Algorithm.


perceptron_script.m and perceptronBetterInitialHyp_script.m are two scripts to use the code.

To find the optimal weights there are 3 methods:

1) perceptron_learningAlgo (the usual)

2) perceptronPocket_learningAlgo (as (1) but it keeps the best current solution)

3) perceptronPocketBetterInitial_learningAlgo (as (2) but is initializes the search on the weights for the linear model)
