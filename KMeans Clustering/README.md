K-Means Clustering. To use this code start with KMeans_script.m, which contains a thorough explanation of the code.

Briefly, the algorithm does the following:

1) Initialize centroids

2) Iterate:

2.1) Compute clusters (assign points to closest centroid) 

2.2) Compute centroids (compute centers of each cluster)
