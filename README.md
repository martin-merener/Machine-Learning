Machine-Learning
================

This directory contains my implementations of different ML techniques. 

They were all coded in Matlab from scratch (using only built-in Matlab functions).

Some of these techniques were implemented via different approaches. For example, SVM is implemented solving the dual via QP, and is also implemented minimizing the primal via gradient methods, such as Newton, and Conjugate Gradient.
