Machine-Learning
================

This directory contains my implementations of different ML techniques. 

They were all coded in Matlab from scratch (using only built-in Matlab functions).

- Support Vector Machines with Kernels (including an efficient mini-batch conjugate gradient implementation)
- Radial Basis Functions
- Neural Networks
- K-means Clustering
- Nearest Mean Classifier with Kernels
- Logistic Regression
- Genetic Algorithms
- Anomaly Detection
- Recommender System via Collaborative Filtering
- Perceptron Learning Algorithm
- Maximal Information Correlation
- Principal Components Analysis
- Linear Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- A digit recognizer simple algorithm with 97.9% accuracy (MNIST-Kaggle competition) 
- Bioinformatics (Pyton implementations of algorithms in http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.com/)

Some of these techniques were implemented via different approaches. For example, SVM is implemented solving the dual via QP, and is also implemented minimizing the primal via gradient methods, such as Newton, and Conjugate Gradient.
