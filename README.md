Machine-Learning
================

This directory contains my own implementations of different ML techniques. These are all coded in Matlab from scratch (using only built-in Matlab functions).

The following is a list of the techniques implemented (up to November 2014).
Some of these techniques were in turn implemented in different ways (e.g., SVM).

- Support Vector Machines (with different Kernels)
- Radial Basis Functions (Gaussian)
- Neural Networks (Classification)
- K-means Clustering
- Nearest Mean Classifier with Kernels
- Logistic Regression
- Genetic Algorithms
- Perceptron Learning Algorithm
- Maximal Information Correlation
- Principal Components Analysis
- Linear Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbors
