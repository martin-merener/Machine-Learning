Machine-Learning
================

This directory contains my own implementations of different ML techniques. These are all coded in Matlab from scratch (using only built-in Matlab functions).

The following is a list of the techniques implemented (up to November 2014).
Some of these techniques were in turn implemented in different via different approaches. For example, SVM is implemented solving the dual via QP, but is also implemented minimizing the primal via gradient methods, such as Newton, and Conjugate Gradient (which can handle much larger training sets than via QP).

- Support Vector Machines (with different Kernels)
- Radial Basis Functions (Gaussian)
- Neural Networks (Classification)
- K-means Clustering
- Nearest Mean Classifier with Kernels
- Logistic Regression
- Genetic Algorithms
- Perceptron Learning Algorithm
- Maximal Information Correlation
- Principal Components Analysis
- Linear Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbors
