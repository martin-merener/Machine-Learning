Nearest Mean Classifier in Feature Space.

To use this code start with NearestMeanClass_script.m

This is a classification technique explained in Learning with Kernels, by Scholkopf-Smola.

It classifies a given point to the class to which center it is closest.
But the centers and distances are computed in a feature space, determined by a kernel of choice. 
The implementation is for binary or one-vs-all if more than 2 classes.

The code contains different possible kernels to be used, and it includes a function that generates training and testing points to try the code.
