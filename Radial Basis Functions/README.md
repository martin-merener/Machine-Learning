Radial Basis Functions.

To use this code start with RBF_script.m.

The script explains in detail how this technique works.

The code can be used for classification (binary or one-vs-all for multiclass), and for regression.

Although currently this code is implemented for the Gaussian radial function, it can be easily adapted to other radial functions, but modifying the function radialOnNorms.m appropriately.
